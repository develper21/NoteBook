>==> DBMS : A Database System is a structured way of storing, managing, and retrieving data so that it is organized, consistent, and easily accessible. Unlike random files on your laptop, a database system ensures security, accuracy, and scalability for large amounts of data.


>==> Data → Raw facts, unprocessed. Example: 101, 102, 103 (student roll numbers).
>==> Information → Processed data, meaningful. Example: "Roll number 101 belongs to Jenil, enrolled in DBMS."
>==> Knowledge → Applying information to make decisions. Example: "Jenil has failed DBMS twice → suggest extra remedial classes."


>===> Functions of DBMS:
--> Store large amounts of data securely
--> Allow multiple users to access data simultaneously
--> Provide backup & recovery features
--> Enforce security rules (who can see what)
--> Ensure consistency of data


>==> Characteristics of Databases
=>Compared to normal file storage, databases provide:

--> Centralized Control – Data stored in one place (shared by all departments).
--> Reduced Redundancy – Avoid storing the same student’s name in multiple files.
--> Consistency – One student’s updated email reflects everywhere.
--> Security – Students can’t see other students’ marks, but faculty can.
--> Concurrency – Multiple students registering for courses at once is handled smoothly.
--> Backup and Recovery – Data is not lost even if the system crashes.

## 6. File System vs Database System

| Aspect              | File System                               | Database System (DBMS)             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Data Storage**    | Stored in separate files                  | Stored in structured tables        |
| **Redundancy**      | High (same data may appear in many files) | Low (data stored once, reused)     |
| **Consistency**     | Hard to maintain                          | Ensured by DBMS rules              |
| **Security**        | Weak (anyone can edit files)              | Strong (access rights, encryption) |
| **Backup/Recovery** | Manual backup needed                      | Built-in recovery mechanisms       |
| **Scalability**     | Not suitable for large data               | Scales to millions of records      |
